Python has evolved extensively since the book was last written. The book is also meant for gently introducing Python, programming, and game development concepts.
I have basically rewritten some of the book's code using advanced python features such as type checking, [iterables] comprehensions, handling loop terminations, regular expressions, lambda functions, etc.
- Each module is a game with docstrings that explain the game's functionality and code structure.
- "rg-sim" files are simulations of AI algorithms for reversegam.

HAVE FUN WITH THE CODE :)
